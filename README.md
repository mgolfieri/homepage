# Coding and technical work
## AWS
Working with Legal to release source code of browser extension developed to enhance productivity of my team, stay tuned!
## Stanford
Mostly found here (at least what could have been release to the public): https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public
Noteworthy projects:
### As Individual Contributor
  * [Kite](https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public/kite), a Kubernetes-based flask data aggregator webapp pulling info about assets from various sources in parallel. Supports Jira, ServiceNow, Datadog, BigFix, Qualys, and others. [Quick preso here](http://tcg.sh/kite-preso).
  * [Giramelo](https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public/giramelo) a Kubernetes-based flask-based app to create complex Jiras through web forms for recurring complex operations activities.  Meant to be easily expanded without programming knowledge via templated structure.
  * [qqualys](https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public/qqualys), a CLI tool to deal with Qualys through its awkward APIs, sparing admins from wasting a good chunk of their lives dealing with the terrible UI and its popups.
### As Manager
  * [su-webmail-redirect](https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public/su-attribute-redirect) a.ka. [99.88% savings by going serverless with Stanford's webmail.stanford.edu](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OcZrye8258Hse8wL2JzXfC0UW4LN4RtRB735fYicOCw) How we cut 99.88% of costs for Stanford's webmail.stanford.edu frontend redirector by going completely serverless. This does not keep into account all the added value inherent to the new architecture in terms of business continuity, scalability and security. Repo links in preso.
  * [35+% reduction in outages or service degradations, and measuring it by means of text analysis on Slack](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gL2RMtxxOYVuDHa2lmhADPzEFS8G_sZtPiZNvjlJ2fQ) How we brought an estimated 35+% reduction in outages throughout Stanford University, and -more importantly- how we assessed it.

##  VMware
Nice try :) I can't share any code produced there, for obvious reasons...  The only public work being disclosed is through my VMware-owned patent, "Automated bug detection with virtual machine forking", filed Aug 31, 2015. [USPTO 14/841,188](https://goo.gl/BLkG8M)
