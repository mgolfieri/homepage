## Stanford work
Mostly found here (at least what could have been release to the public): https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public
Noteworthy projects:
  * [Kite](https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public/kite), a flask-based data aggregator pulling info about assets from various sources in parallel. Supports Jira, ServiceNow, Datadog, BigFix, Qualys, and others. [Quick preso here](http://tcg.sh/kite-preso).
  * [Giramelo](https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public/giramelo) a flask-based app to create complex Jiras through web forms for recurring complex operations activities.  Meant to be easily expanded without programming knowledge via templated structure.
  * [qqualys](https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo-public/qqualys), a CLI tool to deal with Qualys through its awkward APIs, sparing admins from wasting a good chunk of their lives dealing with the terrible UI and its popups.
The rest is available only to Stanford employees. If you are: https://code.stanford.edu/et-iedo
##  VMware work
Nice try :) I can't share any code produced there, for obvious reasons...  The only public work being disclosed is through my VMware-owned patent, "Automated bug detection with virtual machine forking", filed Aug 31, 2015. [USPTO 14/841,188](https://goo.gl/BLkG8M)
